They were a thriving business not so long ago. Then online services transformed the industry, and brick-and-mortar travel agencies died--and died quickly.</p><br>Today, traditional car dealerships are facing much the same threat. Innovative and convenient digital startups and services threaten to disrupt the traditional car-sale process, egged on by consumers who aren't happy with the existing sales process. If car dealerships don't adapt, they too will face an industry-wide extinction.<br><br><i>Perfect Dealership</i> offers help and hope for dealerships struggling to adapt to this digital-based paradigm shift. Consultant Max Zanan applies fifteen years of automotive-industry experience to the future of the car dealership. Arguing that dealerships must make significant changes if they are to survive the coming storm, Zanan takes a close look at every department within the business, including<br>human resources,business development centers,information technology,parts and service, andfinance and insurance.By improving the role of each department and transforming them from individual echelons into a cohesive whole, Zanan offers a road map for the creation of a perfect dealership--the only way to remain relevant and solvent in the digital age.	1977545513	9781977545510	120	72	BOOK	{"Business & Economics / Industries / Automobile Industry","Business & Economics / Management Science","Business & Economics / Training"}	NOT_MATURE	t	0.1.2.0.preview.1	en	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=EUJJDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EUJJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EUJJDwAAQBAJ	f	t	22.90 cm	15.20 cm	0.70 cm	f	f	http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=EUJJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71z96M1zdBGVwq8l74efYLxQCyBp43OKLkWmw_a0YP-_-UU1XMimmELTf5tsOBbXPOmz7K1OlPYcAKXepJibnnSpOhtqpt_BctYuAO0b7qJTS0yMlg35NwL7Nwv0y2K9UNAKLHC&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=EUJJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72xdzKJzCUbQ8La7bZTSns4cS11qKuuXmGBLX01673w_Gqhx10D7yOU235z2TYSBsbdxdqRi0itna7M4jDOBq9ymJN94Ar7DDk0_hzvJJ8MDUTCmYX8ulLDw4dpTVNdfA0bDASa&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=EUJJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73IMt4o1wzN5CzNROjcf8dIqGzcwEXMay_Fs3k-es1mWmRfNaRhHj1-qFDUbpo_SYUvPlcg5Rm2AFEPhyiYg6s-AmPiSl5i3_U3jUf7RYDcI2vWohvAt8UpLO8v-tWf4Or5V8yU&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=EUJJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73wdbN1rxIxfCW2VlVYuoal7bKFD46G0KIhL9USomO0je0Zp_wYWMVYtUUqo3nILF2uahnz0l-37yglfFYQTVp-faTvj0-3jTQHvx9pZCLunvWUaCbaAZnGQdjP7e19brgLxcVf&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=EUJJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72F_5qEIqWn3c1xGpChslIMXD9VAeqxL3e_WdB0dttqmGqNmLKyH5DC_FKjgS8_0XeZWFzSBdZWYltI4JFnGiGSb-sMaORek3BFbJJsWG2VgW1h-u48vE4FiiIIux-OE7RjzGEe&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=EUJJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73tdjNE_oGLwKdAghxiJQ5VL01Yv4k5pxLGbDN3kd_nrpniPhuHc1NTuEvSbxm69PikLAhDMkJD8aDbInUpRFCTdeCow-AHeeLL1HIy3V2-Py09OB1ce0uZY-7NZg3k5vN2TQ03&source=gbs_api	AU	FOR_SALE	t	PARTIAL	t	f	ALLOWED	f	t	http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EUJJDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api	SAMPLE	f	2024-09-03 03:26:05.905119+00	2024-09-06 12:47:29.417646+00

Not only that, Beat Car Dealers does not stop here, but BCD controls the transaction all the way to the end so you will not be taking advantage in the process (finance office), where most dealerships make up their money when they have a loser deal. I will guide all the way from buying to signing sales agreement to the finance contract. I have covered every thing in my ebook not only that, but I am registering only limited dealerships who will follow my program, so you as a customer will be guided, protected all the way until you take delivery of your new car.	146266153X	9781462661534	48	\N	BOOK	{Transportation}	NOT_MATURE	f	preview-1.0.0	en	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=oJl4tgAACAAJ&dq=car+sales&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=56&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=oJl4tgAACAAJ&dq=car+sales&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api	https://books.google.com/books/about/Beat_Car_Dealers.html?hl=&id=oJl4tgAACAAJ	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oJl4tgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oJl4tgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	\N	\N	\N	\N	AU	NOT_FOR_SALE	f	NO_PAGES	f	f	ALLOWED	f	f	http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oJl4tgAACAAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api	NONE	f	2024-09-03 03:27:57.453249+00	2024-09-06 13:13:15.118787+00

Damien Montgomery is a newly-trained member of this elite order. Unable to find a ship to take him on, he joins the crew of a freighter as desperate as he is – without looking hard enough at why they’re desperate. Thus begins an adventure that will take him to the edges of known space and to the limits of his own magic. Starship's Mage: Episode 1 is a 20,789 word novella, the first of five in a serial story.

A car dealer who has a contract with a car manufacturer, for example Mercedes-Benz, is only allowed to sell Mercedes-Benz cars. Only if the dealer has a contract with another car manufacturer, he can sell those cars. The only way to distinguish car dealers is about their consultations and services. By using a good sales promotion, the dealer can amplify his consultations and services and gain new customers. This task offers an insight to sales promotion and shows measures how car dealers can use them. A good sales promotion requires a good planning. It should contain an as-is analysis, i. e. the aims, the target group and the strategy of sales promotion. You have also to plan how to reach the attention of the customers. This preparative work is not part of this task, but it is necessary for the success of the following measures.	364046446X	9783640464463	7	10	BOOK	{"Business & Economics / Marketing / General","Business & Economics / Advertising & Promotion"}	NOT_MATURE	f	1.14.14.0.preview.3	en	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=t01QviAYHroC&hl=&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t01QviAYHroC&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t01QviAYHroC	t	t	\N	\N	\N	f	f	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t01QviAYHroC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE737aLADy5bcYUQhxYu1K9lGux-oqwt8Jf_MUnS9TNPw4syQeb1ef13yR1OkjfA4wOzPUVSprqkQrnTRHx4VE-GNuMcAZUk1Jf0FVn5triphGX0aZR1yylyKeTt3Q9iQZ6Y6Cio6&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t01QviAYHroC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71Licd5VVEmE7zllz-cuu0g7FxCpwaqpbQUq9hdVTl3X0X71ohevnNaKfwLkB7XMs7K-VRq_-hJMZwzxo5cuIsdLOzW5aJY9rWHfn9XeXWwJUP35e7WuTIzxBCJ1MJb6dESXnJz&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t01QviAYHroC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70UVLyvtZrJFZMBSKp84vVJOs-hYlferUpDMunMmSoYO71BYu-Z4iD9v4x5caPKwGgyCYoM17F-EikEN_RBCIiaTHGYP2ire_wqyU6oeIKtfSrUK8i_G2YrRzMrkO5nGG6lx3Ey&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t01QviAYHroC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73RtjHJe8z1-sCBr3uFUx1bfWFm2ASmKGdc-dOH9CfYqV1Fs-LnGpN4r9v184GYXHvvXNhhpBCgJ2sWUSQqTNJ9Z_i4lvh1-6bfiRVkwwYlqLEfO4cmjVNgH8mr6dKwDut8x8jd&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t01QviAYHroC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72sp2rilV0JTP8rskV2iLvWfGIROpHHc0Uzilj7Xr2T2OaYxxcV9r6XKGbPZCFXj87z_dTFSI_5K1A0yiN7fjCS3pWHnChPeNXrIto_S0ZZgeU91oNK1KZpxWIj_mPD5wN7KayR&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t01QviAYHroC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73JrALPG20_pvlG86YML2V_0AZ5w91YtC4U9C5ePPAtd45-V0kRs8guno9129BnOo22KEBT1lGYuoOwZaBMDSYGCVCyqCYjN0xAKDhCJtAcE-TkuOrzXCQAYbAagy9Vs6nrsar8&source=gbs_api	AU	FOR_SALE	t	PARTIAL	t	f	ALLOWED	t	t	http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=t01QviAYHroC&hl=&source=gbs_api	SAMPLE	f	2024-09-03 03:26:06.654183+00	2024-09-06 13:12:03.555467+00

The "Auto Sales Professional's Book Of Secrets" is a compilation of the most successful methods and techniques for closing car sales; with exact scenarios and anticipated customer responses that one can expect prepare you for any situation. Until now, these secrets have never been revealed in a single collection. One on one verbal instructions have always been the teaching format, because the true art of closing sales is more than memorizing words and phrases; it is an entire persona. This is the knowledge that is rapidly disappearing from the newer generations, as the era of professional negotiating is rapidly being replaced by back and forth exchanges of numbers and totally devoid of challenges that reward both buyer and seller with the thrill of winning, and with little incentive to reward individual creativity! Included is an easy-to-reference guide to success that is segmented into short, effective closing techniques for those times that you need "just one more selling point" to achieve that all-important handshake! Also included is an assortment of tips and body language techniques that will add professionalism to enhance your persona and elevate your sales to their maximum numbers, and with the absolutely highest profits.

Lawson and the “ladies on the lot” take readers behind the scenes of one of the last bastions of a predominantly male workplace: the car dealership. Linking the women’s own stories within the broader framework of gender and occupation, Lawson presents an engaging and important case study on the impact of gender differences and behavior in the workplace. In doing so, Ladies on the Lot makes an original contribution to the field and will be of interest for a wide variety of courses, including gender and occupations, the sociology of work, the sociology of women, and various courses in women’s studies and qualitative methods.	1461638577	9781461638575	159	\N	BOOK	{"Social Science"}	NOT_MATURE	f	0.5.3.0.preview.3	en	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=fRm_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=car+sales&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fRm_AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fRm_AAAAQBAJ	t	t	\N	\N	\N	f	f	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fRm_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fRm_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	\N	\N	\N	\N	AU	FOR_SALE	t	PARTIAL	t	f	ALLOWED	t	t	http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fRm_AAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api	SAMPLE	f	2024-09-06 07:15:23.181+00	2024-09-06 12:24:04.310367+00

CAR SHARKS and CLOSERS is a complete automobile sales training manual with only one goal - to train salespeople, sales managers and finance managers to close car sales at maximum gross profit and with 100% customer satisfaction ratings! That's it - closing sales; period! The training begins with the decision on where the new hire wants to work and how to actually get hired, even if there is no job opening. Next, the new hire is helped through the training period and put on a fast track to success! It virtually eliminates failure by preparing them for the frustrations, and helps overcome the mind games and misdirection from their peers, and the "wait and see if they make it before I invest much time" attitude from their trainers. Whether a salesperson or manager, this manual contains exact closing methods with scripts and the body language so critical to their success! It also explores the psychology of why these closes work so well. The secrets of making multiple passes to achieve maximum profits while maintaining guaranteed customer satisfaction are revealed in complete detail. Managers at all levels will benefit from this training. All of the techniques included in this training are proven and highly successful in producing the highest possible closing percentages. The scripts included contain the exact words that are best used verbatim. Naturally, the person using these closes should inject their own personality and body language into the verbiage, but it should be noted that, over the years, every single one of these individual closing scenarios has each earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions for this author. Every single one! That's why I know they work so well, because I perfected them over the years, and each time a similar situation arose, I necessarily tweaked the presentation to fit the circumstances until they worked the majority of the time. Whether you are a new salesperson, a sales manager or dealer, these methods are the same. Used car managers can benefit from the structure and appraisal methods and most everyone in the dealership can employ these methods with success. There has never been any training to match the intensity and perfection contained within this manual; learn it well, because it works!	1480025178	9781480025172	306	306	BOOK	{"Business & Economics / Sales & Selling / General","Business & Economics / Sales & Selling / Management"}	NOT_MATURE	f	preview-1.0.0	en	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Gv7SMgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gv7SMgEACAAJ&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gv7SMgEACAAJ	f	f	22.90 cm	15.20 cm	1.70 cm	\N	\N	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gv7SMgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&imgtk=AFLRE70zZNwPB8bLh0FyrHuhJdIQo8vEdR1ISGFjpwWURblF1Km1h-TzXwCD1T-hIejAkqchhhIdGgHsnZ6sTnQYIGo3l_sM1O669TX9E_kBDN1IOHMnO4m6TgEJ4i9y6xEjMUkEyYyV&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gv7SMgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73nk9tiNWrY0XNBkbdq3U7oouvWlqmfo5Yh8BKk4ZWskPN9JpTGXZZqhySsLzhfM4RidX5cseKUg3S6zNnGtAC5cV51CsWwF7uZ3ZTsBixHiXUFDNsFzMPq6ZXTpPWyayUkJYWR&source=gbs_api	\N	\N	\N	\N	AU	NOT_FOR_SALE	f	NO_PAGES	f	f	ALLOWED	f	f	http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Gv7SMgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api	NONE	f	2024-09-03 03:26:11.206437+00	2024-09-06 12:42:13.860474+00

These four techniques are called exponential smoothing, decomposition, ARIMA, and multiple regression. To do so I picked one dependent (Y) variable along with two independent (X) variables and collected 80 monthly observations for each variable. This historical data allowed me to create four different forecasting models which predict future Vehicle Sales with low risk of error. The best model according to the lowest error measures was winter’s exponential smoothing method because it had the lowest MAPE along with the lowest RMSE for the fit period as well as the forecast period.	365673562X	9783656735625	54	\N	BOOK	{"Business & Economics"}	NOT_MATURE	f	0.3.4.0.preview.3	en	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Za33DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=car+sales&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=21&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Za33DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Za33DAAAQBAJ	t	t	\N	\N	\N	f	f	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Za33DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Za33DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	\N	\N	\N	\N	AU	FOR_SALE	t	PARTIAL	t	f	ALLOWED	t	t	http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Za33DAAAQBAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api	SAMPLE	f	2024-09-03 03:26:08.781014+00	2024-09-06 13:19:41.584812+00

Your raise becomes effective when you do.</p> <p>Damian Boudreaux started out cleaning parts in his friend's transmission shop. From there, he tried and stumbled and tried again to sell more cars than the month before. It wasn't until he began to open his eyes and pay attention to the people around him that he understood what it really takes to succeed in the automotive business. The lessons he learned during his journey to becoming a consistently top-selling salesman are humbling and inspiring at the same time.</p>	1630474002	9781630474003	226	226	BOOK	{"Business & Economics / Sales & Selling / General","Business & Economics / Sales & Selling / Management","Business & Economics / Industries / Automobile Industry","Transportation / Automotive / General"}	NOT_MATURE	f	preview-1.0.0	en	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=CnMMrgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CnMMrgEACAAJ&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CnMMrgEACAAJ	f	f	21.60 cm	14.00 cm	1.20 cm	f	f	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CnMMrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&imgtk=AFLRE71ty6ZtC621qNjBKZDvLj_L77b0E9eSx_2v376LPDZRfatMlaLDOizbPBWdAg_K0py7C6ipf_i8Ke7TYgmTGz01GcqKIO1IPy2zveY6zadpQ85TMGaICkbb2fWSUkm7yO1cAr_H&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CnMMrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE739Uthu7RoUEnMLX7ahQR4-YCRvhO7pKy41D4bPT0TRpnL68mlUMWch_7Ro1_mVwfl3umbjoz7XnNbR7NxvaQ98BY50YLNeSdSL2PK3kjeA9KZvTxfsBXykA-QSz1WgxY_XlBUh&source=gbs_api	\N	\N	\N	\N	AU	NOT_FOR_SALE	f	NO_PAGES	f	f	ALLOWED	f	f	http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CnMMrgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api	NONE	f	2024-09-03 03:26:09.812373+00	2024-09-06 13:07:22.648821+00

Anyone in sales can benefit from learning the sales techniques that author Joe Sabatini explains for how to sell cars, warranties and protection packages. The author shares his knowledge, insight and personal experiences as a successful car salesman and successful finance and insurance manager so you can learn from him and take your sales career to the next level. In the eight chapters of this book you will learn how to motivate yourself to fully engage with every customer and create your own opportunities for success. When you really listen and hear what your customers have to say, you will create a bond with them that will build the rapport and trust with them that is critical to close your sale. Where the book really delivers is with the chapters on the 76 Closes. In the introduction, the author advises that if you don't have time to read this book in its entirety, you can skip to this chapter on sales closing techniques, and still reap terrific benefits. In this automotive sales training guide, you will learn about how to handle specific types of customers and various closing situations. What do you do when your customer decides to be difficult and shuts you down? Read Joe's Shut Down Close to glean the bit of information that will make the close easier. What about the customers that show up with Consumer Reports in their hands? Not one, but two closes are dedicated to this customer. Sprinkled throughout this invaluable chapter are Catch All Closes that can be used in a variety of situations when you are having trouble determining which strategy to employ. Becoming a highly effective sales person takes passion and a burning desire to make a connection with your customers as well as knowledge of how to close deals. With your passion and the excellent information in this book on how to build a connection with customers and close car sales, you will be ready to take the lead in any sales situation and rise to the top of your sales floor in any market.	1942489285	9781942489283	\N	\N	BOOK	\N	NOT_MATURE	f	preview-1.0.0	en	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=XeZbMQAACAAJ&dq=car+sales&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=58&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=XeZbMQAACAAJ&dq=car+sales&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api	https://books.google.com/books/about/76_Cash_Making_Deal_Saving_Closes_for_Sa.html?hl=&id=XeZbMQAACAAJ	f	f	\N	\N	\N	f	f	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XeZbMQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XeZbMQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	\N	\N	\N	\N	AU	NOT_FOR_SALE	f	NO_PAGES	f	f	ALLOWED	f	f	http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XeZbMQAACAAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api	NONE	f	2024-09-03 03:27:57.766315+00	2024-09-06 13:13:30.568661+00

Kk3IzQEACAAJ	NL5tDLrkdNE	https://content-books.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Kk3IzQEACAAJ	How To Overcome Auto Sales Objections	{"A C Rodriguez","E R Rodriguez"}	Independently Published	2020-08-24	Learning how to overcome the buyer's objections is the key to closing the sale. A successful sales associate knows that objections are simply the manner in which buyers communicate their status in the buying process. When the sales associate learns how to overcome objections and turn or create them to his/her advantage, the number of closed sales will be increased. As a sales professional, it is absolutely vital to understand and to be prepared for the most common sales objections. Mastering every detail and feature of the vehicle is important, but knowing and understanding the true reason for the buyer's objection is equally crucial. When a sales associate has a full understanding of the buyer's wants and needs along with the knowledge of all options and features of the vehicles offered, he/she will be ready to answer and overcome any objection. Sales, by its nature, is associated with objections. Accepting that and knowing how to overcome them by creating credibility and trust is part of the sales process. Overcoming objections can change the buyer's perception of what is being presented and sold. Sales is the art of presenting the vehicle at the exact angle that best suits your conversation with the customer.	\N	9798678760432	124	\N	BOOK	\N	NOT_MATURE	f	preview-1.0.0	en	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Kk3IzQEACAAJ&dq=car+sales&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=47&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Kk3IzQEACAAJ&dq=car+sales&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api	https://books.google.com/books/about/How_To_Overcome_Auto_Sales_Objections.html?hl=&id=Kk3IzQEACAAJ	f	f	\N	\N	\N	f	f	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kk3IzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kk3IzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	\N	\N	\N	\N	AU	NOT_FOR_SALE	f	NO_PAGES	f	f	ALLOWED	f	f	http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Kk3IzQEACAAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api	NONE	f	2024-09-03 03:27:56.080995+00	2024-09-06 13:10:55.242217+00

Most underperforming dealerships are doing so not because of the car line they sell, the location theyre in, their employees, or even the advertising but for only one reasonfear. The word fear may sound nonsensical to a dealer who has been in business for thirty years or more, but ask yourself a few questions. If your store is not performing, do you know why? If so, why havent you made important changes? A dealer from a premium franchise recently admitted that he avoids changes in order to keep his staff of over twenty years intact. This is what I call broken thoughts. Youll find out how to overcome these broken thoughts with the three-car sales system described in this book and how to turn your dealership into a well-oiled machine.	1504918495	9781504918497	75	\N	BOOK	{"Business & Economics"}	NOT_MATURE	t	1.2.2.0.preview.3	en	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=jSQKCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=car+sales&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=31&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jSQKCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jSQKCgAAQBAJ	t	t	\N	\N	\N	f	f	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jSQKCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jSQKCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	\N	\N	\N	\N	AU	FOR_SALE	t	PARTIAL	t	f	ALLOWED	t	t	http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jSQKCgAAQBAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api	SAMPLE	f	2024-09-03 03:26:10.256673+00	2024-09-06 13:08:50.977329+00

Joe began his working career as a shoeshine boy. He moved on to be a newsboy for the Detroit Free Press at nine years old, then a dishwasher, a delivery boy, stove assembler, and home building contractor. He was thrown out of high school, fired from more than forty jobs, and lasted only ninety-seven days in the U.S. Army. Some said that Joe was doomed for failure. He proved them wrong. When Joe started his job as a salesman with a Chevrolet agency in Eastpointe, Michigan, he finally found his niche. Before leaving Chevrolet, Joe sold enough cars to put him in the Guinness Book of World Records as 'the world's greatest salesman' for twelve consecutive years. Here, he shares his winning techniques in this step-by-step book, including how to: o Read a customer like a book and keep that customer for life o Convince people reluctant to buy by selling them the right way o Develop priceless information from a two-minute phone call o Make word-of-mouth your most successful tool Informative, entertaining, and inspiring, HOW TO SELL ANYTHING TO ANYBODY is a timeless classic and an indispensable tool for anyone new to the sales market.	0743273966	9780743273961	196	\N	BOOK	{"Business & Economics"}	NOT_MATURE	f	0.1.1.0.preview.0	en	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=shy_qCdGFLkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=car+sales&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=9&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com.au/books?id=shy_qCdGFLkC&dq=car+sales&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api	https://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_Sell_Anything_to_Anybody.html?hl=&id=shy_qCdGFLkC	f	f	\N	\N	\N	f	f	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=shy_qCdGFLkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=shy_qCdGFLkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	\N	\N	\N	\N	AU	NOT_FOR_SALE	f	PARTIAL	t	f	ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY	f	f	http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=shy_qCdGFLkC&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api	SAMPLE	f	2024-09-03 03:26:06.95424+00	2024-09-06 13:13:54.324103+00

7955800c-79fc-43ae-944e-f77e0fa10ea3	\N	3	Gus DeBree's 'Introduction To Auto Sales' is a utilitarian plunge into the gritty mechanics of automotive salesmanship. The book offers a pragmatic guide, distilled from DeBree's 35 years of industry experience, and is peppered with no-nonsense advice aimed at aspirants eager to navigate this often cutthroat field. Yet, the prose is resolutely functional, mirroring the transactional nature of its subject. DeBree's commitment to the craft is palpable, but one might yearn for a more artful touch or a deeper exploration of the human nuances in sales. The book's strength lies in its structured approach and emphasis on lifelong learning—a nod to the enduring grind of sales. However, for those seeking a more literary or reflective take on the profession, the text may fall short. A solid starting point for budding salespeople, but not a transformative read.	2024-09-06 12:08:03.379586+00	8vhnAgAAQBAJ

The book promises a comprehensive foundation, covering everything from understanding corporate structures to finalizing sales and earning commissions. However, while the content is undeniably practical and potentially lucrative for dedicated readers, it suffers from a lack of engaging prose and narrative flair.

However, the prose is often dry and formulaic, lacking the narrative flair that might engage a broader audience. While the text provides valuable insights into the mechanics of car sales and the corporate structure, it sometimes veers into the territory of an extended help-wanted ad rather than a compelling educational manual.

With 35 years of combined experience, DeBree and his co-authors plot a course through the labyrinthine world of automotive sales, offering nuggets of wisdom and practical advice. The book’s strength lies in its detailed exposition of sales techniques and its encouragement of lifelong learning—key to navigating the high-octane environment of car dealerships. However, the prose often feels as slick and rehearsed as a seasoned salesperson’s pitch, lacking the narrative verve that could make this a truly compelling read.

The book is both an engaging ethnography and a critical examination of the intersection of gender and occupation.

The 'ladies on the lot' are not just subjects; they are vibrant narrators of their own tales, offering a mosaic of experiences that reflect the intricate dance of gender and occupation. Lawson's work is a significant contribution to the sociology of work and gender studies, illuminating how these women carve out spaces for themselves in a male-dominated industry. While the book occasionally delves into academic jargon, its overall narrative remains accessible and compelling.

Lawson deftly navigates the microcosm of the car dealership, a domain traditionally dominated by men, with the keen ethnographic eye of a sociologist and the narrative flair of a seasoned storyteller. Lawson's exploration is not merely a presentation of data but a nuanced portrayal of gender dynamics in a commercial setting.

Its large format provides ample space for meticulous record-keeping, an act almost ceremonial in its attention to detail. Each section invites the user to encapsulate the essence of their automotive exchanges—date, model, reasons for sale—transforming mundane transactions into a narrative of ownership and loss. Yet, this book, while utilitarian, lacks depth; it is a tool without aspiration, a ledger that does not engage the imagination. It serves its purpose, but one longs for a spark of literary flair amidst the practicality. It is, in the end, a solid companion for the car enthusiast, yet it remains firmly tethered to the ground, leaving the literary spirit unchallenged.	2024-09-06 13:12:13.676631+00	xp_EtAEACAAJ

This logbook, spaciously formatted, invites users to chronicle every detail of their vehicular transactions with an almost bureaucratic precision. It strips away the frills of narrative and dives straight into the mechanics of buying and selling.

It offers ample space for the essentials: dates, serial numbers, and the like, yet one can't help but feel a twinge of nostalgia for the days when logging sales was more about the stories than the spreadsheets. This logbook is functional, yes, but it lacks a certain zest that would elevate it beyond mere utility. For the diligent seller, it serves its purpose; for the romantic, it’s a reminder that sometimes, the poetry of transactions gets lost in the paperwork. A useful tool, but don’t expect it to spark joy. It’s a solid 3 out of 5.	2024-09-06 13:12:13.676631+00	xp_EtAEACAAJ

This book, ostensibly a vehicle for recording transactions, feels more like a bureaucratic tool, devoid of the narrative flourishes that could elevate it beyond mere utility. The structure is painfully prosaic, offering little more than a series of blank pages to fill with sales data, lacking the charm or insight that might transform the act of selling cars into something more profound. While it serves its purpose for the diligent seller, one cannot help but mourn the absence of creativity in a world that thrives on stories.

Each section invites a sense of order; the meticulous layout embodies a utilitarian spirit. Yet, one cannot help but yearn for a touch of narrative flourish, a whisper of the human stories behind each transaction. The log is not merely a collection of dates and signatures, but a repository of fleeting moments and transactions that reflect the broader human experience.

Yet, one wonders if the act of logging, rather than selling, might ultimately reveal more about the seller than the sale. In its simplicity lies an invitation to ponder the deeper implications of ownership and exchange, a reminder that even in the world of cars, the human element remains indelibly present, lurking in the margins of ink and paper.	2024-09-06 13:12:30.911061+00	nls7tAEACAAJ

However, while the author's intent is commendable, the execution lacks the depth of insight one might expect. The prose is serviceable but feels more instructional than reflective, leaving the reader yearning for a richer exploration of the emotional stakes involved in such transactions. Z.N.A's insistence on controlling the process is both reassuring and somewhat stifling, as it risks reducing the complexities of negotiation to mere algorithmic exchanges. Thus, while "Beat Car Dealers" provides a useful framework, it ultimately skirts the deeper narratives of desire and aspiration that fuel the car-buying experience.	2024-09-06 13:13:17.995774+00	oJl4tgAACAAJ

In the end, it’s a reminder that sometimes, clarity and utility are the greatest virtues.	2024-09-06 13:13:51.368854+00	1Z_PswEACAAJ

Its blank pages await the ink of ambition and commerce, inviting the seller to etch the ephemeral dance of vehicle transactions into permanence.

A practical tool, indeed, but perhaps lacking the depth that those who tread the asphalt of life might seek.	2024-09-06 13:13:51.368854+00	1Z_PswEACAAJ

The prose meanders through the mechanics of persuasion and rapport-building, echoing the transactional nature of human connection. Yet, beneath the polished surface lies a stark reminder of the commodification of self. Hackwell’s insights, while practical, often feel like a checklist rather than an exploration of the deeper implications of salesmanship.
